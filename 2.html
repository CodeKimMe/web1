  <p>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany,
  the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2(This Mary,
  whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who
  poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.)
  3So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
  4When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death.

  <p>No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through
  it.”5Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6So when he
  heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days,
  7and then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”<br>
  8“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried
  to stone you, and yet you are going back?”</P>
